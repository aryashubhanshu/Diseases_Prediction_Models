## What is Diseases Prediction?
Disease prediction is the use of machine learning algorithms to identify individuals who are at high risk of developing a disease before they actually develop any symptoms. By analyzing large amounts of data, such as medical records, genetic data, and lifestyle data, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and risk factors that are associated with different diseases. 

### How ML models predict?
Machine learning Models can help identify patterns and risk factors that may not be immediately apparent to human analysts, allowing for more comprehensive and accurate risk assessments.

Machine learning Models can also help reduce healthcare costs by identifying high-risk individuals who can benefit from preventive measures and interventions, which can reduce the need for costly treatments and hospitalizations.

### Machine Learning Techniques

In this project we have implemented the model using five different algorithms that are:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naives Bayes
Logistic Regression
K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
Decision Tree

In each of the five prediction models, we have calculated the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and the F1 score.  

### Conclusion

In conclusion, disease prediction using machine learning has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes by identifying individuals who are at high risk. However, this approach faces several challenges, including data privacy concerns, ethical issues, and interpretability. 

Overall, disease prediction using machine learning is a promising area of research that has the potential to revolutionize healthcare.
