# What is Diseases Prediction?
Disease prediction is the use of machine learning algorithms to identify individuals who are at high risk of developing a disease before they actually develop any symptoms. By analyzing large amounts of data, such as medical records, genetic data, and lifestyle data, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and risk factors that are associated with different diseases.
